# Welcome to Meta Eden
Meta Eden is a place where you're free to share well-constructed ideas, aptly called 'seeds', related to [Eden](https://genesis.eden.eoscommunity.org/) and EOS, [Fractally](https://fractally.org), EOSIO and [Mandel](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/mandel).  

We invite you to freely share your thoughts as well as your positive attention, collaborate and expand upon other's ideas via opening issues and pull requests when appropriate. Seeds you plant here should contain all information for the idea to grow into reality.  

*This isn't the place for core code edits, nor is it the place for explanatory material, nor discourse outside of opening issues.*

## How it Works

You'll find **specific topics** where Eden and EOS show an opportunity to improve **in folders** in this repository under the EOS + Eden directories. 

Browse .md files in these folders to read other's suggestions related to that topic. 

If you'd like to improve another seed you see, **first open an issue on the topic** via the issues tab. 

If you've already done this, and are ready to move on to **formalize** the changes, open a **Pull Request (PR)**. Elders will review this pull request. 

If you have suggestions to improve this repo, *please open an issue.*
